```elixir
def get_result(x, y, b) do
  # Shift b to the right by 31 bits (since it's a 32-bit integer)
  shifted_b = b >> 31
  
  # Perform bitwise AND operation between x and shifted_b
  # This will be used to mask out the lower 32 bits of x if b is 1
  masked_x = x & ~(~0 << 31)
  
  # If b is 1, return masked_x; otherwise return y
  (shifted_b == 0 &&& masked_x) || y
end
